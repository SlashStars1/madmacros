The goal of this project is to allow users to input a restaraunt/cuisine, a calorie limit and a protein goal. Then the website outputs to them a list of menu items
that are within (or close to) that range. 

The csv nutrition tables used were from Ryan Ashcraft's git repo "restaurant-nutrition-data"!
