The goal of this project is to allow users to input a restaraunt/cuisine, a calorie limit and a protein goal. Then the website outputs to them a list of menu items
that are within (or close to) that range. Users can also login to favorite meals and take a look at all the meals they favorited in the "Favorites" tab. The main technologies used to create this were Node JS, React JS, Express JS, and Mongo DB (MERN Stack). My Backend is hosted on Heroku and the frontend site is on Vercel.
